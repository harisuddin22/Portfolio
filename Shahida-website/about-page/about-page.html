        <h1>About Shahida</h1>
        <p>
          Shahida is an online clothing store that offers high-quality,
          affordable, and fashionable clothes for women of all sizes and styles.

        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          Shahida was founded in 2023 by Shahida Khan, a passionate fashion
          lover who wanted to create a platform for women to express themselves
          through their outfits. She started by selling her own designs on
          social media, and soon gained a loyal customer base. She then
          partnered with local suppliers and manufacturers to expand her product
          range and offer more variety and quality. Today, Shahida has over
          10,000 customers across Pakistan and beyond, and is one of the leading
          online clothing stores in the country.

        <h1>Our Inspiration</h1>
        <p>
          Shahida’s ‘aha!’ moment came when Shahida Khan received a message from
          a customer who thanked her for making her feel confident and beautiful
          in her clothes. She realized that her website was not just about
          selling clothes, but about empowering women and making them happy.
